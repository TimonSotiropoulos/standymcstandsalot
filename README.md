# StandyMcStandsaLot

This is a new slack bot integration that handles a stand up for you. It will start your stand up every day at 10am, and then check every 30 minutes until all users in the team have responded for the day. If everyone has not replied by 12pm, it will print out what everyone is up to for the day. Users simply need to enter the channel and talk and the information will be saved to the slack bot history as what they wish to communicate for the day.
